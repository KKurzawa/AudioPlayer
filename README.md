# Audio-Player

## Description

An audio player built with React and deployed with Vercel.  

## Usage

Upon loading the user is presented with the first audio track/artist/album cover, a button to display all tracks, a button to choose repeat one/shuffle, forward/back buttons, a play button, and volume button that displays a volume slider when clicked.  When playing the album cover rotates and an audio visualizer appears responding to the frequency of the audio for an interesting effect.
